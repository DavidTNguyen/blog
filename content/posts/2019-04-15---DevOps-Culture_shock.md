>*‚ÄúWhy would you worship a god that went away for three days and abandoned his subjects? Our (sun) God rises faithfully every morning.‚Äù*

I wrote this mid-flight heading back home to Minneapolis from Japan. The 20-hour trans-pacific flight is an irresistible chance to jot down thoughts on the whole trip. Over hot Matcha and Senbei, I finally had some moments to gather myself, decompress and reflect over what transpired over the last 10 days. Flipping back and forth a torn copy of ‚ÄúSilence‚Äù, an old historical novel by Sh≈´saku End≈ç, I was looking for a better context for the whirlwind tour I just concluded. The book was later adapted into many movie versions of the same title, most recent one was directed by Martin Scorsese. It tells the story of a Catholic missionary priest in early 17th century Japan, who apostatizes to save the lives of several people, and then becomes a retainer of the local lord, but continues to keep the Christian faith in private. The character is based on the historical figure of Giuseppe Chiara, who was a major influence into how Christianity spread into Vietnam, my home country. The quote resonated with me of how even after centuries of wars and conflicts in religion, business, and trade, there is still a huge gaping hole in our cultural understanding.

I was invited to present at DevOps Day conference in Tokyo. Even though the trip was short, it left a deep impression on me about Japan. Most of my interactions were with engineers and software engineers from all over Asia. There were six of us, English speakers from either US or Europe, presented at the event. Our host was beyond gracious and hospitable. Japanese organizers brought out the red carpet from the day we landed, until the day of departure.

The jam packed three days schedule left me very much in a dizzy mental state. I even had a bit of ‚Äúculture shock,‚Äù but not in the same sense Americans typically experience. I travel outside the country once or twice a year, but this trip was viscerally different. It‚Äôs the first time I got an in-depth look at how IT engineering cultures outside of the U.S. undergo DevOps transformation. And the contrast is significant.

Many scholars compare culture to how an ice-berg appears to human eyes. Less than 10%, the tip, is visible. The other 90% is completely hidden. During my impromptu mobbing session with the 100 plus students who attended our workshop, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice some distinctive behaviors. My data scientist colleagues back home would laugh at the size of my sample of population üòÖÔ∏è. It‚Äôd be absurd to generalize over the entire culture group. Nevertheless, here are some of my observations:

¬∑     Japanese people are punctual. It‚Äôs evident in the way the highly dense city of 50 million people wakes up every morning and rush out to every train station across town. Nobody wanted to be late. Anthropologists typically describe this as a common behavior from a high-risk avoidance society. I only saw a sea of people pushing through the morning hour because the clock is not very forgiving.

¬∑     Upon arrival in class, all of my students were extremely polite. Formality was deeply coded into their language, social etiquette, and decorum.

¬∑     They bowed to the elder and teacher to show respect. A sign of the Confucius influence that I am too familiar with. 1st the King, 2nd the master, and finally Father.

¬∑     No direct eye-contact. Once again, it‚Äôd be impolite to ‚Äústare‚Äù.

¬∑     During lunch break, the lines formed orderly for the Bento box, which were delicious. üç±Ô∏è

It wouldn‚Äôt be a stretch to state that Tokyo itself as a city is undergoing a massive DevOps transformation. Infrastructure projects erected almost at every major train, subway, and even Shinkansen stations. There are signages printed brightly in multiple languages, also English-speaking staff standing by to guide visitors to the next destinations. There are even billboards at ticket booth promising commuters they would soon be able to use ApplePay for their rides. Google map is as accurate as it gets; I got around the major cities like Tokyo, Osaka with assistance from Street VR and translation app without a hitch.  They country is indeed at full speed ahead getting ready for the 2020 Olympics.

Those were just the visual representation of the 10% of the tip of the cultural iceberg. What then are the remaining constituents that make up the invisible 90%? Experts went on to identify things like authority, gender roles, traditions, history, religion, concept of truth, etc... the parts that make up of one‚Äôs worldview.

In the most perfect morning of the Sakura blooming season, I had a chance to visit the Sengaku-Ji temple, also the historical burial site of the 47 Ronins, whose stories had been retold in countless books and movies. A short train ride from the bustling Shinagawa station placed me right at the heart of the tranquil burial ground of the 16th century master-less samurais.  The rich history of Japan is safely guarded right in the heart of Tokyo. Perpetual clocks of modernity and sacred grounds of tradition co-exist side by side in the most enigmatic fashion.  There are parts of this culture that is so sacred and deeply held that no foreign words can be employed to describe without compromising its essence.

In that very framework, I must ask myself this question - if DevOps, as we often heard, is a culture, then which context is it conceived and cultivated in? Whose voice is being heard? What is the narrative of those human stories? Why do many companies fail to adopt DevOps in a Cross-Cultural team? Why do companies fail in the attempt to expand beyond domestic markets üòâÔ∏è? To understand the root cause, one must examine the fundamental flaws of two Agile fundamental values. How ‚ÄúIndividuals and Interactions over processes and tools‚Äù (1st value) failed to scale either in the U.S, or gain support overseas? How the lack of understanding of the political nature of time had crippled us in ‚Äúresponding to change over following a plan‚Äù (4th value).

During the keynote delivered at DevOpsDay ‚Äì Tokyo, Gene Kim emphasized why Lead Time is the single most important metric in DevOps, far more indicative than ‚Äúvanity‚Äù numbers like number of releases per day. Time-based metric is the ultimate measurement. American engineers, I‚Äôm one of them, position ourselves in relationship to time comes out of histories of European and Western thought. And a lot of the way that we talk about time finds its roots in the Industrial Revolution. Prior to that, we would talk about time as merely passing the time. After the Industrial Revolution, suddenly, we begin to talk about time as spending time. It becomes something that is tethered to monetary value. When we think about hourly wage, we now talk about time in terms of wasting time or spending time. And that's a really different understanding of time than seasonal time or time that is merely passing (prof. Brittney Cooper, Rutgers)

In today‚Äôs global business environment, where companies are pressed to maintain profit margins in order to survive, innovation holds the key to ensuring their new product development efforts lead to innovations with mass appeal. To cultivate innovation for effective global engineering teams, we want to know how cultures differ in their concepts of innovation and the impact of those differences on approaches to developing new products. 

Because global new products are increasingly developed in, by, and for multiple cultures, a particular need is for a culturally reflective understanding, or conceptualization of innovation. While innovation is believed to be culturally tied, the dominant framework of innovation used in business and management assumes that innovation is culturally indifferent or agnostic. This knowledge gap is addressed by studying the role of innovation in Agile practices in a cross-cultural or global context. 

First, it is widely accepted that American culture is deeply individualistic. The DNA of this belief is hardwired into the very first statement of Agile value ‚ÄúIndividuals and Interactions over processes and tools‚Äù. I challenge you to find within the Agile manifesto any mention of the words like ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù or ‚Äúcommunal‚Äù. I found the irony was rich in how DevOps and Agile organizations benefited greatly from the open-source movement, but yet refuse to acknowledge that they stand on top of the shoulders of others.

Secondly, if time is a center piece of all metrics in DevOps, then we also need to understand time also has a ‚Äúrace‚Äù, a race in the contemporary way that we understand race in the United States. Who are the ones owning the time? And who are the ones running the clock? Who gets to determine how much your time is worth? Who get to decide how much time you should invest in your own learning? The hour, min, seconds that DevOps saved has a direct correlation to financial performance. And who are the ones reaping the benefit? (Prof. Brittney Cooper‚Äô TED Talk). The transfer of the profits gained from automation, the key component of DevOps, didn‚Äôt seem evenly distributed. Why does it matter? Because it changed the incentive and it made me wonder who are the real benefactors of these gains.

## Technical Shame
Technical Debt is a phrase many DevOps leaders have been struggling to define. A frequent topic for discussion at every conference I‚Äôve ever attended. Let me try to explain it in an Asian way. The only way I know how. My growing up in Saigon - Vietnam was with a very large family of 9, mom/dad and my 7 older siblings. I‚Äôm the youngest. We used to live altogether in a crammed 700 sq. apartment on a 4th floor building with no elevator. I got up at midnight to fetch fresh water and carried the exact equivalent of 40 gallons, the rationed amount by the communist government for a family of our size. We endured extreme scarcity of resources. In the absence of a stable and trustworthy financial banking system, every working adult in the family pooled together every saving pennies toward a single goal, owning our very own apartment.

In Vietnam during the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs, there was no such thing as down payment, no interest-only payment option, no 7-year ARM, no 15 to 30-year fix rate, no collaterals. Why? There is a deeply held belief in our culture that debt is a shameful burden for one to bear. The feudalistic economy over a thousand years has long ingrained into people‚Äôs psyche that debt must be paid in full. Failure to comply resulted in feudal lords enslaving you from one generation to the next. The coolies and peasants would be extremely lucky to pay off their debts. The reality was most of them never did.  It was an unattainable goal to shed off that financial burden, and hence, they carried on the ‚Äúshame‚Äù from one generation to the next, bearing that stigma that was associated with the lowest casts in society. 

It‚Äôs a long way to get to my point, but that trip down the memory lane was to explain the reason why the first time I heard of the term ‚ÄúTechnical Debt‚Äù, the Vietnamese within me squirmed. Now, that I am ‚ÄúAmericanized,‚Äù debt is not so bad, is it? Money can always be printed. Thanks Fed Chair.

## Final thoughts on shame.
Brene Brown, is a popular author among American business leaders, who was the very first scholar that ever tackled the topics of vulnerability and shame. Her works, thanks to Oprah, are the favorites for many book clubs across the country. I even spotted that some of her talks got translated into Japanese and Chinese. My criticism is that shame portrayed here was strictly in the context of American individualism. The shame was internalized at the individual level, but never communal or corporal. Thankfully, she has since acknowledged shame can be experienced differently across cultures. I just wish there are more non-U.S. born authors (Viet Thanh Nguyen, Celeste Ng, Eduardo Bonita Silva, Iris Chang, etc...) got recognized for speaking on this topic. If the blemish of this technical shame was to be washed away, our technical fitness was to be redeemed to wholeness, we ought to change the narrative of how we should address it. The debt must be paid communally at the corporate level, and not individual. And every now and then, a little bit of shame wouldn‚Äôt hurt üòÄÔ∏è
