My African refugee friends, who spent a large part of their adult years in the slump of Democratic Republic of Congo 🇨🇩️, offered this observation: "In America, everybody has watches, but nobody has time." They have little use for clocks, still often described distance the old way and said that to walk from his apartment to school would take two washes of laundry 🗑️ and a pot of rice 🍚️. In medieval Europe, people spoke similarly of “three paternosters”, or two boiling eggs. Me as someone grew up in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam 🇻🇳 would say "it would take two trays of egg-roll" 🙂️

This sort of thing is extremely common. In places without clocks, time is measured by actions rather than action being measure by time. Time is not a grid against which work can be measured, because the work is the measure itself.

Sometimes truth and wisdom can be found amidst abject poverty. Isn’t it true that any time-based metrics always get measured by a set of predefined actionable steps? Isn’t that the very essence of engineering automation? As I reflect over the conversation with my friends in the context of the 4th Agile value - “responding to change over following a plan.” I started to realize why so many product/engineering teams were setup for failure when deadlines drop on them like tropical rain.

So instead of asking “how long does it take to complete this task?”, why don’t we ask “How can this task be broken down to smaller tasks, or equate it to similar tasks team are proficient in?”
